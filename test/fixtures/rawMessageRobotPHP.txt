Subject: 08-05-2015 - AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES – FRA2 – PLANNED MAINTENANCE NOTIFICATION
X-PHP-Originating-Script: 0:ccMailCron.php
From: support@prolexic.com
Reply-To: support@prolexic.com
Organization: Akamai Technologies 
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text=plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
X-Priority: 3
X-Mailer: PHP5.5.11


Location(s): Frankfurt (FRA2)
Date: Wednesday Aug 5, 2015 22:00:00 UTC to Thursday, Aug 6, 2015 02:00 UTC 
Duration: 4 hours
Priority: Normal
Reason:  Preparation to add equipment to the Frankfurt scrubbing center that will facilitate Akamai’s expansion of production traffic handling capacity.
Description:  Akamai Technologies will be carrying out maintenance between Wednesday Aug 5, 2015 22:00:00 UTC to Thursday, Aug 6, 2015 02:00 UTC.
During the maintenance Anycast will be pulled from the Frankfurt scrubbing center. Customer may see tunnel flaps however these alerts can be safely ignored as the corresponding BGP session will be down in the Frankfurt scrubbing center.
Once the Frankfurt scrubbing center has Anycast removed, customers will see a re-convergence of sessions to the nearest relevant scrubbing centers which in this case will most likely be LON and DCA. At the end of this maintenance window the FRA2 site will re-announce Anycast and route traffic normally. Please do not hesitate to contact the Akamai Security Operations Center should you have any questions or concerns.
